The diagram shows the following steps:

The browser sends a DNS request to the DNS server to look up the IP address of the domain name "www.google.com".
The DNS server returns the IP address of the Google server to the browser.
The browser establishes a TCP/IP connection with the IP address of the Google server.
The traffic is encrypted by the HTTPS/SSL protocol.
The traffic is passed through the firewall.
The request is distributed to the load balancer.
The load balancer forwards the request to the web server.
The web server generates the web page.
The application server requests data from the database.
The database returns the data to the application server.
The application server generates the web page.
The web server sends the web page back to the browser.
